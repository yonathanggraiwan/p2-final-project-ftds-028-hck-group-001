## Problem Background

The invention of 

When assessing credit risks, analysts use the 5 C's of credit : Character, Capacity, Capital, Collateral, and Conditions. **Character** refers to your credit history, or how you've managed debt in the past. **Capacity** refers to your ability to repay loans. **Capital** includes the savings, investments, and assets you are willing to put toward a loan. **Collateral** is something you can provide as security, typically for a secured loan or secured credit card. **Conditions** include other information that helps determine whether you qualify for credit and the terms your receive (Capital One, 2024).

Since these 5 C's significantly take time for analysts to analyze, therefore, it is important to have a computer model that can evaluate the customer’s credit risk to streamline the process of giving loans. By using computer models, the process of evaluating loans would be halved and more loans can be given out in a much more shorter time span. The risk of miscalculating the risk of a loan would be further reduced due to further verification using computer models.

Our research and analysis is further reinforced a research article done by R. Balina & M. Idasz-Balina outlining the [Drivers of Individual Credit Risk of Retail Customers](https://doi.org/10.3390/risks9120219) where the article outlines the factors and example use cases of modelling and the factors that can determine the credit risk of a customer based on other factors other than the 5 C's outlined above.(Balina & Idasz-Balina, 2021).

## Project Output

1. Models :

    The project would output multiple different models to be evaluated and compared to each other. If the user wishes to use a different model to the ones already selected, the user can find the models in `models` folder.

2. Analysis :

    Analysis of the data is compiled in the `EDA.ipynb` where all the explenations of data and analysis would be inserted and can be viewed. The analysis can also be seen in our deployment in [Streamlit] or [HuggingFace]

## Possible Users :

- Bankers
- Tellers
- Banks

## Method
1. [RandomForestClassifier](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dsa/random-forest-classifier-using-scikit-learn/)

    Random Forest is a method that combines the predictions of multiple decision trees to produce a more accurate and stable result. It can be used for both classification and regression tasks. In classification tasks, Random Forest Classification predicts categorical outcomes based on the input data. It uses multiple decision trees and outputs the label that has the maximum votes among all the individual tree predictions.
